Connection Command Summary

	ubersol> [name] + <ssh-address> <cli-user>

		CLI> [ local=>localhost:2222, aws=>54.90.102.251:2222 ]
		SFTP> [ lftp=>localhost:2222 ]


List CLI session context:

The `context` command displays operational context for CLI sessions.

Because you can be in multiple sessions, `ubersol` tends to hide the operational
context of each session as expressed in their CLI prompt. To see the current
context of any session use the `context` command.

    ubersol> [name] context
    - Displays CLI context for each matching session

    EX:
    ubersol> * context
        Showing CLI context for '*'...
        ubersol> * context
            Showing CLI context for '*'...
            dkr> xenakis(configure/hardware/message-spool)#


And if you want to leave, just type:

	ubersol> exit
