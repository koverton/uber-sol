Ubersol is a Solace management tool that enables executing CLI and SFTP 
commands across multiple management connections. When you connect to a 
Solace broker that connection is cached with a name provided by you, 
so later when you want to execute a command you can name the connection 
or connections to execute it against, or even use a wildard to execute 
against multiple connections. Neat, huh?
